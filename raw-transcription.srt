1
00:00:16,448 --> 00:00:18,748
Yeah

2
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:25,548
Let's ride

3
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:32,348
Sunrise paints the heartland gold,
Another day to break the mold

4
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:38,548
Got my rig, a trusty friend
On this road that'll never end

5
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:46,148
Beneath the wide and starry sky
Embracing this freedom's cry

6
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:52,348
From the mountains to the plains
Watching where the city stands

7
00:00:53,648 --> 00:01:00,048
Yeah, we're singing 'bout freedom, trucks, and guns
Oh, underneath that blazing sun

8
00:01:00,848 --> 00:01:09,548
A good old burger made in the USA
Living out our dreams the American way

9
00:01:09,848 --> 00:01:17,848
Got that bass thumping with a little bit of twang
Letting that Liberty Bell ring and hang

10
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:31,448
Two-lane blacktop, windows down, cruising through a dusty town
A little bit of hip-hop beat shuffling to my own two feet

11
00:01:31,948 --> 00:01:40,548
This ain't just a way of life, it's cutting through the noise and strife
With a rifle in the rack, ain't no turning back

12
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:47,148
Here we're singing 'bout freedom, trucks, and guns
Oh, underneath that blazing sun

13
00:01:47,848 --> 00:01:56,848
A good old burger made in the USA
Living out our dreams the American way

14
00:01:56,848 --> 00:02:05,048
Got that bass thumping with a little bit of twang
Letting that Liberty Bell ring and hang

15
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:23,848
From the fields of Idaho to the Texas heat
Grilled onions on a sizzling patty, can't be beat

16
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:29,648
This is the sound of America, raw and true
For the red, white, and blue, me and you

17
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:59,105
Made in the USA
