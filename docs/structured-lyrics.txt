[Intro]
Yeah... let's ride.

[Verse 1]
Sunrise paints the heartland gold, another day to break the mold
Got my rig, a trusty friend, on this road that'll never end
Beneath the wide and starry flag, a promise in this freedom swag
From the mountains to the plains, washing away the city stains

[Chorus]
Yeah, we're singing 'bout freedom, trucks, and guns
Underneath that blazing sun
A good old burger, made in the USA
Living out our dreams the American way
Got that bass thumpin', with a little bit of twang
Lettin' that liberty bell ring and hang

[Verse 2]
Two-lane blacktop, windows down, cruising through a dusty town
A little bit of hip-hop beat, shuffling to my own two feet
This ain't just a way of life, it's cutting through the noise and strife
With a rifle in the rack, ain't no turning back

[Chorus]
Yeah, we're singing 'bout freedom, trucks, and guns
Underneath that blazing sun
A good old burger, made in the USA
Living out our dreams the American way
Got that bass thumpin', with a little bit of twang
Lettin' that liberty bell ring and hang

[Bridge]
From the fields of Idaho to the Texas heat
Grilled onions on a sizzlin' patty, can't be beat
This is the sound of America, raw and true
For the red, white, and blue, me and you

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Freedom, trucks, and guns...
Yeah...
Made in the USA...
